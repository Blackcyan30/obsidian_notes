## Answer:

**Claim:** In any instance of the Stable Matching Problem where there exists a man m and a woman w such that m is ranked first on w's list and w is ranked first on m's list, the pair (m, w) must appear in every stable matching.

**Answer:** True.

**Justification:**

Assume for contradiction that there is a stable matching S in which (m, w) is not paired together. Then, in S, m must be paired with some other woman w′ and w must be paired with some other man m′. However, since m’s top choice is w, m prefers w over w′. Similarly, since w’s top choice is m, w prefers m over m′. Hence, the pair (m, w) would both prefer to be matched with each other rather than their current partners, forming a blocking pair. This violates the stability condition of S. Therefore, (m, w) must be part of every stable matching.

**Conclusion:** The statement is true.
