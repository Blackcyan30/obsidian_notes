## Answer:

**Claim:** The statement “The fewest conflicts first scheduling algorithm solves the interval partitioning problem optimally” is **false**.

**Counterexample:**

Consider the following set of lectures (intervals), where if one lecture ends at time $t$ and another starts at $t$, they do not conflict.

- Lecture A: [0, 4]
- Lecture B: [1, 2]
- Lecture C: [2, 3]
- Lecture D: [3, 4]
- Lecture E: [4, 8]
- Lecture F: [5, 6]
- Lecture G: [6, 7]
- Lecture H: [7, 8]

**Conflict Counts:**
- Lecture A overlaps with B, C, and D $\rightarrow$ 3 conflicts.
- Lectures B, C, D each overlap only with A $\rightarrow$ 1 conflict each.
- Lecture E overlaps with F, G, and H $\rightarrow$ 3 conflicts.
- Lectures F, G, H each overlap only with E $\rightarrow$ 1 conflict each.

**Optimal Partitioning:**
- Note that lectures A and E do not conflict (A ends at 4, E starts at 4).
- An optimal solution is to assign lectures A, B, C, and D to one classroom and lectures E, F, G, and H to a second classroom.
- Thus, only 2 classrooms are needed.

**How "Fewest Conflicts First" May Fail:**
- A fewest conflicts first algorithm would tend to schedule the lectures with only 1 conflict (B, C, D, F, G, and H) before scheduling those with 3 conflicts (A and E).
- If you greedily assign classrooms in this order, the algorithm might put B, C, D in one room and F, G, H in another.
- Then when scheduling A (which overlaps B, C, D), A cannot join the first room and must get a new room.
- Similarly, E (which overlaps F, G, H) would force yet another room.
- This scheduling could use 3 or more classrooms, even though the optimal number is 2.

**Conclusion:**
The fewest conflicts first scheduling algorithm does not always yield an optimal solution to the interval partitioning problem.

## Simple Explanation:

The optimal way to assign lectures to classrooms minimizes the number of classrooms to the maximum number of overlapping lectures. In our example, although some lectures (B, C, D, F, G, H) conflict with only one other lecture, scheduling them first forces the longer lectures (A and E) to be scheduled later—when they overlap with already assigned lectures. This can force the use of more classrooms than necessary (more than 2), even though we know that the best arrangement uses only 2 classrooms. Thus, the “fewest conflicts first” method can be suboptimal.
