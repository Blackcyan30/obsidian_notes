## Detecting an Odd Cycle in a Graph

The key observation is that a graph has an odd-length cycle if and only if it is not bipartite. Thus, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) (or DFS) to try to two-color the graph. If at some point we find an edge connecting two vertices of the same color, the graph has an odd cycle.

### Pseudocode

function hasOddCycle(Graph G):
    // Initialize all vertices as uncolored
    for each vertex v in V(G):
        color[v] = UNCOLORED

    // Process each component of G
    for each vertex v in V(G):
        if color[v] == UNCOLORED:
            color[v] = RED
            initialize empty queue Q
            enqueue v into Q

            while Q is not empty:
                u = Q.dequeue()
                for each neighbor w of u:
                    if color[w] == UNCOLORED:
                        // Assign opposite color to w
                        color[w] = (color[u] == RED) ? BLUE : RED
                        enqueue w into Q
                    else if color[w] == color[u]:
                        // Found two adjacent vertices with the same color => odd cycle
                        return True

    // No conflicts found: graph is bipartite, so no odd cycle exists
    return False

### Time Complexity Derivation

- Initializing the color for all vertices takes $O(V)$ time.
- The BFS over each connected component processes each vertex and each edge once, resulting in $O(V+E)$ time overall.
- Therefore, the entire algorithm runs in $O(V+E)$ time.

### Simple Explanation

1. **Idea:**  
   A graph is bipartite if you can divide its vertices into two sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set with a vertex in the other. If a graph is not bipartite, then it contains an odd cycle.

2. **How the Algorithm Works:**  
   - We start by marking all vertices as uncolored.
   - Then, for each uncolored vertex, we start a BFS, coloring it (say, RED) and then every neighbor BLUE.
   - When a vertex is encountered that is already colored, we check: if it has the same color as its neighbor from which it was reached, then thereâ€™s an edge connecting two vertices of the same color. This means the graph cannot be divided into two sets without conflict, implying an odd cycle exists.
   - If we complete the BFS for all vertices without finding such a conflict, the graph is bipartite (and has no odd cycle).

3. **Time Complexity:**  
   The algorithm goes through each vertex and edge only once, so its overall time is proportional to $O(V+E)$.

This pseudocode and explanation together provide an efficient solution to detect odd cycles in a graph.
