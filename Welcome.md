## Huffman Encoding Problem and Algorithm

**Problem Statement:**  
Given a set of characters with associated frequencies (or weights), the goal of Huffman encoding is to assign binary codes to each character so that the total (weighted) length of the encoded message is minimized. This is done by constructing a binary tree (the Huffman tree) in which each leaf represents a character. More frequent characters are placed closer to the root so that they receive shorter codes.

**Huffman Algorithm (Outline):**
1. **Initialize:**  
   Create a leaf node for each character and insert it into a priority queue (min-heap) keyed by frequency.

2. **Iterate:**  
   While there is more than one node in the queue:
   - Remove the two nodes with the smallest frequencies.
   - Create a new internal node with these two nodes as children and with frequency equal to the sum of their frequencies.
   - Insert the new node back into the queue.

3. **Finish:**  
   The remaining node in the queue is the root of the Huffman tree.  
   Traverse the tree to assign a binary code to each character (assign 0 to one branch, 1 to the other, and accumulate the bits as you descend).

**Key Point:**  
Huffman coding always produces a full binary tree (each internal node has two children). For an alphabet with 4 characters, the tree will have exactly 4 leaves.

## Question: "The Huffman encoding of a 4-char set may include a code of length 4."  
**Answer:** False.

**Explanation/Justification:**

- Since the Huffman algorithm builds a full binary tree with 4 leaves, it turns out that the maximum depth of such a tree is 3.  
- In any full binary tree, if there are $$L$$ leaves, the maximum depth is minimized when the tree is as balanced as possible.  
- With 4 leaves, even in the worst-case (most unbalanced) full binary tree, the maximum code length (i.e. the depth of the deepest leaf) is 3.
- To have a code of length 4, the tree would need at least 5 leaves.  
- Therefore, no Huffman code produced from a 4-character set can have a codeword longer than 3.

**Simple Explanation:**  
If you only have 4 characters, the Huffman tree you build has 4 leaves. The longest path from the root to a leaf (i.e. the maximum code length) in such a tree can be at most 3. Thus, it's impossible for a Huffman encoding on a 4-character set to contain a code of length 4.

## Huffman Encoding Problem

### What Is It?

The Huffman encoding problem is a classic problem in data compression. Given a set of characters (or symbols) each with a specified frequency (or weight), the goal is to assign each character a binary code (a string of 0’s and 1’s) so that:
- No code is a prefix of any other (this is called a prefix-free code).
- The total cost, defined as the sum of (frequency × code length) for all characters, is minimized.

In simpler terms, we want to encode data using as few bits as possible by giving more frequent characters shorter codes and less frequent characters longer codes.

### General Solution

The optimal solution is achieved by constructing a binary tree called the **Huffman Tree**. The key steps are:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a leaf node for each character and store these nodes in a priority queue (min-heap), where the priority is the frequency of the character.

2. **Build the Huffman Tree:**
   - **While** there is more than one node in the queue:
     - Remove the two nodes with the smallest frequencies.
     - Create a new internal node with these two nodes as children.
     - Assign the new node a frequency equal to the sum of the frequencies of its children.
     - Insert the new node back into the priority queue.
   - The last remaining node in the queue becomes the root of the Huffman Tree.

3. **Assign Codes:**
   - Traverse the Huffman Tree from the root to each leaf.
   - Assign a binary digit (e.g., 0 for a left branch and 1 for a right branch) along the path.
   - The binary code for each character is the concatenation of the digits on the path from the root to that character’s leaf.

### Why It Works

Huffman’s algorithm is greedy because at each step it combines the two least frequent nodes—this local optimal choice leads to a globally optimal prefix-free code that minimizes the overall cost. The resulting codes ensure that no code is a prefix of any other, which makes them uniquely decodable.

### Simple Explanation in Plain Words

Imagine you need to compress text by assigning binary codes to letters. If a letter appears very often, you want its code to be short so that your overall text uses fewer bits. Huffman encoding does exactly that. It builds a tree where each letter is a leaf. Letters that occur frequently end up closer to the root (shorter code), while rare letters are deeper in the tree (longer code). This process guarantees the best (optimal) way to compress the text without any ambiguity.

This is the Huffman encoding problem and its general solution in a nutshell.




## (a) Definition of an Independent Set

An **independent set** in a graph \(G = (V, E)\) is a subset of vertices $(S \subseteq V)$ such that **no two vertices** in \(S\) are connected by an edge. In other words, for every pair of distinct vertices \(u, v \in S\), the edge \((u, v)\) does **not** belong to \(E\).

## (b) Pseudocode for Determining an Independent Set of Size \(k\)

We assume \(k\) is a **constant**. The algorithm below enumerates all subsets of vertices of size \(k\) and checks if any such subset is independent.

```python
def has_independent_set_size_k(G, k):
    # G: graph with vertices V and edges E
    # k: constant

    # Generate all subsets S of V of size k
    for S in all_subsets_of_size_k(V, k):
        # Check if S is an independent set
        if is_independent(G, S):
            return True
    
    # No subset of size k was independent
    return False

def is_independent(G, S):
    # G: graph with edges E
    # S: subset of vertices
    for each pair (u, v) in S with u < v:
        if (u, v) in E:
            return False
    return True
